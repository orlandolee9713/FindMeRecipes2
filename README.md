My final project was something that seems simple but was far from that. I designed this app using React but the new technology that I implemented into it was adding the Router to it.

The Apps design is pretty simple. A user would type any type of food ingredient into the search bar and the app would generate the top twelve recipes with that ingredient in it based on the food2fork api that I obtained and used as a third-party.

The App also displays the image of the finalized dish as well as a link to the publishers website who food2fork obtained the recipe information from.

The App also includes certain small features like a back button which allows the user to toggle back to the original home page and view more recipes of their choice.

I find this app could be very useful especially for someone like me. I am always the guy who stares into the refrigerator and pantry looking at tons of things that I could use to make a meal, but somehow always finds a reason to shrug their shoulders and say "we don't have anything to eat".

The App simply gives you a bunch of different ideas to avoid being stuck in a "food-less" situation.
